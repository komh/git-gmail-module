NAME
    Net::SMTP::SSL - SSL support for Net::SMTP

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::SMTP::SSL;
  
      my $smtps = Net::SMTP::SSL->new("example.com", Port => 465);

DESCRIPTION
    Implements the same API as Net::SMTP, but uses IO::Socket::SSL for its
    network operations. Due to the nature of "Net::SMTP"'s "new" method, it
    is not overridden to make use of a default port for the SMTPS service.
    Perhaps future versions will be smart like that. Port 465 is usually
    what you want, and it's not a pain to specify that.

    For interface documentation, please see Net::SMTP.

SEE ALSO
    Net::SMTP, IO::Socket::SSL, perl.
